# UI

- debug tools (watches, breakpoints)
- 'someone died' / 'winner' popup
- assembler: toggle between verbose and code output (sync scrolling as well)

# Preprocessor

- support for FOR/ROF blocks
- allow label-only-lines
- asserts

# Logic

- tournament mode (zeus called by )
- winner/score calculation (zeus)
- preprocessor needs the current environment, so building w/o known parameters is somewhere between incorrect and not doable

# Refactoring

- better UI/code separation
