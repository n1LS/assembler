# UI

- debug tools (watches, breakpoints)
- 'someone died' / 'winner' popup

# Logic

- round counter / maximum number of steps before auto-stop (zeus)
- winner/score calculation (zeus)
- preprocessor needs the current settings, so building w/o known parameters is somewhere between incorrect and not doable

# Refactoring

- better UI/code separation
